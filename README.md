# The Data Science Accelerator 🚀
**A Curated Roadmap from Python Fundamentals to Agentic AI Architecture**

Welcome to the **Data Science Accelerator**. This repository is a comprehensive library of **40+ Open Source Projects** designed to bridge the gap between "Learning to Code" and "Building Systems." 

I have curated these projects based on my experience as an **NHS Lead Data Scientist** and **Founder (Twacha Labs)** to help beginners navigate the complexity of modern AI.

## 👨‍🏫 Mentorship & Philosophy
I believe that the best way to learn is to build. Technology has been democratised; the differentiator today is the **Agentic Mindset**—the ability to pick a problem and architect a solution from scratch.
